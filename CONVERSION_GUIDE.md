# How to Complete the Conversion

This document explains how to fetch the actual content from the note.com article when you have internet access.

## Quick Start

If you're running this in an environment with internet access, simply run:

```bash
python3 fetch_and_convert.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch the article from https://note.com/handshuffling/n/n83bbad08cbbd
2. Download all images to the `images/` folder
3. Replace `article.html` with the actual converted content

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## What Gets Created

After running the script successfully:

- `article.html` - The complete article with all styling
- `images/image_001.jpg` - First image from the article
- `images/image_002.png` - Second image from the article
- ... and so on for all images in the article

## Troubleshooting

### SSL Certificate Errors

If you encounter SSL certificate errors, you can try:

```python
# Add this to fetch_page() function if needed
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30, verify=False)
```

Note: Disabling SSL verification is not recommended for production use.

### Cloudflare or Anti-Bot Protection

Some websites use anti-bot protection. If you encounter issues:

1. Try using a different User-Agent string
2. Add delays between requests
3. Consider using Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites

### Rate Limiting

If you're downloading many images:

1. The script includes a 0.5-second delay between image downloads
2. You can increase this by modifying the `time.sleep(0.5)` value
3. Be respectful of the server's resources

## Manual Alternative

If the script doesn't work, you can manually:

1. Visit the URL in your browser
2. Right-click and "Save Page As..." â†’ Choose "Webpage, Complete"
3. Copy the images to the `images/` folder
4. Update the HTML file to reference local images

## Testing

After conversion, open `article.html` in your browser to verify:

- All text is properly formatted
- All images are loading
- Links work correctly
- The page is responsive on different screen sizes

## Next Steps

Once you have the converted content:

1. Review the HTML for any formatting issues
2. Adjust the CSS if needed (it's embedded in the HTML file)
3. The page is completely standalone and can be shared/deployed anywhere
